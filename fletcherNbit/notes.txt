requires two summations for increased error detection (basically, redundancy)
placed next to each other (n bit digests => 2n bit digest)
16, 32, 64 use same algorithm but different amount
	idea that bigger is better
checksums aren't about being broken - they have no security compared to hashes
	but easier to compute, maybe a good usage would be for packet analysis

checkbytes are basically checksum for checksum (lost in transmision)
	to be frank even c1 is just that
	triple nested checksums, wow

i learned about the main method
	and presumably, how things like command line arguments work


switching the bytes that are read in swaps the final bytes by pairs (for the 32 bit one) 
	i ended up getting this problem every time because i forgot hwo the other ones worked
