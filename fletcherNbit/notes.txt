requires two summations for increased error detection (basically, redundancy)
placed next to each other (n bit digests => 2n bit digest)
16, 32, 64 use same algorithm but different amount
	idea that bigger is better
checksums aren't about being broken - they have no security compared to hashes
	but easier to compute, maybe a good usage would be for packet analysis

checkbytes are basically checksum for checksum (lost in transmision)
	to be frank even c1 is just that
	triple nested checksums, wow
